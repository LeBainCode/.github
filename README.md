# Le Bain Code

Welcome to Le Bain Code - A deep dive into programming excellence. Taking inspiration from the French coding school tradition, we offer an immersive learning experience that pushes students beyond their comfort zone.

## About Us

Le Bain Code is an intensive programming training program that follows the "sink or swim" philosophy. Just as École 42's famous "piscine" challenges students through total immersion, our program plunges participants into real-world coding scenarios from day one.

## Our Philosophy

- **Total Immersion**: Learn by doing, not just watching
- **Peer Learning**: Collaborate and grow together
